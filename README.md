It forms the final project of my Level 5 AI & Machine Learning bootcamp and is designed as a clear, end-to-end example of a full ML workflow: data loading, exploration, preprocessing, modelling, evaluation, and interpretation.

The aim was to build something practical, transparent, and easy for other developers to follow, while showing how sensor data can support early detection of mechanical issues in robotic systems.

</p> <p> I used the Robot Execution Failures dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 463 samples, each representing 16 possible robot failure types, with 90 features derived from force/torque readings at 15 time steps.

No personal or sensitive information is included. All analysis is strictly technical and focused on system behaviour.

</p> <p> Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Workflow: Parsing the dataset into a usable structure, quality checks (duplicates, imbalance), exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. </p> <p> Ten algorithms were tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, SVM (linear and RBF), k-NN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, MLP, and a Stacking Classifier. The Stacking Classifier achieved the strongest overall performance at around 69% accuracy. </p> <p> Frequent failure classes were predicted reliably, while rare classes remained challenging due to limited representation. Feature importance indicated that early-stage sensor readings contributed most to predictive performance. </p> <p> I also created a small Arduino-based demonstration using my robot arm to illustrate several of the failure patterns seen in the dataset. This includes obstructions, collisions, and servo stall behaviour. The demo code is included as AT_RobotArmExp_V10.ino. </p> <p> Limitations include dataset imbalance, small sample size, and difficulties with under-represented classes. The project is a proof of concept; further data and calibration would be required for production deployment. </p> <p> Files included: full notebook (AT_RobotFailures_V9.ipynb), demonstration code, supporting README, original dataset, and planning document. </p> <p> This project reinforced the importance of strong exploratory analysis, appropriate preprocessing, and careful evaluation when working with imbalanced multi-class problems. It also highlighted the benefits of ensemble methods for stability and reliability across complex datasets. </p>
